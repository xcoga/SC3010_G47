
Condition:
- webpage MUST be written in PHP.


Attack flow:
1) Upload the file onto the PHP webpage
2) There will be a page where the attacker can see his uploaded items
e.g. https://example.com/uploads/hello_world.txt

3) This is where the attacker realises he can open a PHP webshell.

4) The webpage should contain a HTTP GET request such that:

https://example.com/uploads/malicious.php?cmd=ls
Do note that after the '?' it is the query string in a HTTP GET request.

For PHP interpreter, it will execute the PHP code if it is a PHP file.
For .txt files, it will simply be displayed.
