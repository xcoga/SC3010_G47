Condition:
- webpage MUST be written in PHP.


Attack flow:
1) Upload the file onto the PHP webpage
2) There will be a page where the attacker can see his uploaded items
e.g. https://example.com/uploads/hello_world.txt

3) This is where the attacker realises he can open a PHP webshell.

4) Attacker opens the webshell.
- The link will fail, since it is an executable that needs input
- simply add this '?cmd=ls' at the end of the link containing 'malicious.php?'
- should look like this: 'http://localhost:4000/php_app/uploads/malicious.php?cmd=ls'
